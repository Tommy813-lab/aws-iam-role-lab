# 🛡️ AWS IAM Role Lab

This is my hands-on lab for mastering AWS IAM roles, policies, and access control. Built to show I know how to lock down cloud resources while keeping things practical and real.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

Real-world IAM setups I’ve built and tested:

- Clear steps you can follow (Console + CLI)  
- Least-privilege JSON policies that actually work  
- Use cases that matter: EC2 talking to S3, Lambda writing to DynamoDB, cross-account role access  
- Screenshot reminders so I can document everything right

## 🧪 Use Cases

| What | Why |
|-------|------|
| [EC2 to S3 Access](use-cases/ec2-to-s3-access.md) | Let an EC2 instance read/write S3 buckets safely with a role |
| [Lambda to DynamoDB](use-cases/lambda-to-dynamodb.md) | Give Lambda permission to put data into DynamoDB tables |
| [Cross-Account Role Assumption](use-cases/cross-account-role-assume.md) | Allow one AWS account to assume roles in another securely |
